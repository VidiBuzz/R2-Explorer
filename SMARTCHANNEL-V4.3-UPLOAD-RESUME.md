# SmartChannel v4.3 - Upload Resume & File List Refresh

**Release Date:** October 22, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Deployment
**Previous Version:** v4.2

---

## üéâ What's New in v4.3

### ‚úÖ Automatic Upload Resume After Crashes
**The Problem:** Large file uploads (>95MB multipart uploads) would fail completely if the browser crashed, connection dropped, or user accidentally closed the tab. Users had to restart the entire upload from scratch.

**The Solution:** SmartChannel now automatically saves upload progress to localStorage and can resume from the last successfully uploaded chunk!

**How It Works:**
1. **Automatic State Persistence** - Every uploaded chunk is saved to localStorage with its ETag
2. **Smart Resume Detection** - On restart, checks for incomplete uploads and resumes automatically
3. **7-Day Window** - Can resume uploads within 7 days (matching R2's multipart upload lifecycle)
4. **Progress Preservation** - Resumes from exactly where it left off, skipping already-uploaded chunks

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses Cloudflare R2's `resumeMultipartUpload(key, uploadId)` API
- Stores upload state in localStorage: uploadId, completed parts (ETag + partNumber), chunk size
- Validates chunk size matches before resuming (prevents corruption)
- Automatically cleans up upload states older than 7 days

### ‚úÖ File List Auto-Refresh After Upload
**The Problem:** After uploading files, users had to manually refresh the page to see newly uploaded files in the file list.

**The Solution:** File list now automatically refreshes after all uploads complete, showing newly uploaded files immediately.

### ‚úÖ Proper Multipart Upload Abort
**The Problem:** Cancelled multipart uploads weren't properly aborted on the server, leaving orphaned partial uploads in R2.

**The Solution:**
- Added `/api/buckets/:bucket/multipart/abort` endpoint
- Cancelled uploads now properly call `abort()` on R2 multipart upload
- Clears local resume state after abort
- Failed uploads preserve resume state for later retry

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Changes

### New Files Created

**1. `src/utils/upload-resume-manager.js`**
- Manages localStorage persistence of upload state
- Tracks uploadId, completed parts, chunk size, timestamps
- Provides methods: `startUpload()`, `recordPart()`, `getUploadState()`, `canResume()`, `clearUpload()`
- Auto-cleanup of stale uploads (>7 days)

**2. `src/modules/buckets/multipart/abortUpload.ts` (Worker)**
- New API endpoint for aborting multipart uploads
- Calls R2's `multipartUpload.abort()` method
- Returns success/failure status

### Modified Files

**1. `packages/dashboard/src/components/utils/DragAndDrop.vue`**
- Imported `uploadResumeManager`
- Added resume logic before creating new multipart upload:
  - Checks `canResume()` for existing upload state
  - Resumes with existing `uploadId` if available
  - Skips already-uploaded parts
  - Continues from next part number
- Saves each uploaded part via `recordPart()`
- Clears resume state on successful completion
- Aborts multipart upload on cancel
- Preserves resume state on failure (allows retry)
- Added `cleanupOldUploads()` after upload batch completes

**2. `packages/worker/src/index.ts`**
- Imported `AbortUpload` class
- Registered new route: `POST /api/buckets/:bucket/multipart/abort`

**3. `packages/dashboard/src/appUtils.js`**
- Added `multipartAbort(key, bucket, uploadId)` method

## üîç How Upload Resume Works

### Scenario: User uploads 500MB file, browser crashes at 60%

**Without Resume (v4.2 and earlier):**
1. User uploads 500MB file (6 parts √ó 95MB chunks)
2. Browser crashes after uploading parts 1-3 (285MB uploaded)
3. Upload fails completely
4. User must restart from 0MB ‚ùå

**With Resume (v4.3):**
1. User uploads 500MB file (6 parts √ó 95MB chunks)
2. Each part is saved to localStorage as it completes:
   - Part 1: ‚úÖ Saved (ETag: abc123, partNumber: 1)
   - Part 2: ‚úÖ Saved (ETag: def456, partNumber: 2)
   - Part 3: ‚úÖ Saved (ETag: ghi789, partNumber: 3)
3. Browser crashes
4. User reopens browser and re-selects the same file
5. SmartChannel detects existing upload state:
   - Found uploadId: "xyz-upload-123"
   - Completed parts: 1, 2, 3
   - Next part: 4
6. Resumes upload from part 4 (285MB already uploaded) ‚úÖ
7. Uploads remaining parts 4-6
8. Completes upload successfully

### Storage Structure (localStorage)

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "uploads": {
    "candid-studios:photos/wedding.mp4:524288000": {
      "bucket": "candid-studios",
      "key": "photos/wedding.mp4",
      "fileSize": 524288000,
      "uploadId": "xyz-upload-123",
      "chunkSize": 99614720,
      "completedParts": [
        {"partNumber": 1, "etag": "abc123"},
        {"partNumber": 2, "etag": "def456"},
        {"partNumber": 3, "etag": "ghi789"}
      ],
      "startTime": 1729598400000,
      "lastUpdate": 1729598450000
    }
  }
}
```

**Storage Key Format:** `{bucket}:{key}:{fileSize}`
**Why fileSize?** Ensures we don't resume an upload if the file was modified

## üîí Safety Features

### 1. Chunk Size Validation
- Resume only works if chunk size matches original upload
- Prevents corruption from mismatched chunk boundaries

### 2. 7-Day Expiration
- Matches R2's automatic multipart upload abortion (7 days)
- Stale uploads are auto-cleaned from localStorage
- Prevents resume attempts on expired server-side uploads

### 3. Graceful Fallback
- If resume validation fails, creates new upload automatically
- User never experiences errors, just starts fresh

### 4. Abort on Cancel
- Properly aborts server-side multipart upload
- Frees up R2 resources immediately
- Prevents orphaned partial uploads

## üéØ User Experience Improvements

### Before v4.3:
- ‚ùå Upload crashes = start over from 0%
- ‚ùå File list doesn't update after upload
- ‚ùå Cancelled uploads leave orphaned data in R2

### After v4.3:
- ‚úÖ Upload crashes = resume from last completed chunk
- ‚úÖ File list auto-refreshes after upload completes
- ‚úÖ Cancelled uploads properly cleaned up
- ‚úÖ Failed uploads can be retried (resume state preserved)
- ‚úÖ Works across browser restarts
- ‚úÖ Works after accidental tab close
- ‚úÖ Works after network disconnection

## üß™ Testing Upload Resume

### Manual Test Procedure:

1. **Prepare Test File:**
   - Create a file >200MB (to ensure multipart upload)
   ```bash
   dd if=/dev/urandom of=test-large-file.bin bs=1M count=300
   ```

2. **Start Upload:**
   - Upload the file to SmartChannel
   - Watch the upload progress popup

3. **Simulate Crash (choose one):**
   - **Option A:** Close browser tab mid-upload
   - **Option B:** Close entire browser mid-upload
   - **Option C:** Disconnect network mid-upload
   - **Option D:** Refresh page mid-upload

4. **Resume Upload:**
   - Reopen browser / reconnect network
   - Navigate back to media.candidstudios.net
   - Select the **exact same file** again
   - Observe console: "Resuming upload for {filename} from part X/Y"
   - Upload continues from where it left off ‚úÖ

5. **Verify localStorage:**
   - Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage
   - Find key: `smartchannel_upload_resume`
   - Verify upload state is saved with uploadId and completed parts

6. **Verify File List Refresh:**
   - Upload a file completely
   - Observe file list automatically updates without page refresh
   - Newly uploaded file appears immediately ‚úÖ

## üîß Configuration

No configuration changes required. Upload resume is automatic and enabled by default.

**localStorage Key:** `smartchannel_upload_resume`
**Storage Version:** 1
**Resume Window:** 7 days
**Chunk Size:** 95MB (99614720 bytes)

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **File Must Be Identical** - Resume only works if you select the exact same file (same size, same name)
2. **7-Day Window** - Cannot resume uploads older than 7 days (R2 auto-aborts them)
3. **Browser-Specific** - Resume state is per-browser (localStorage), not cross-device
4. **Chunk Size Change** - If chunk size changes between versions, cannot resume old uploads
